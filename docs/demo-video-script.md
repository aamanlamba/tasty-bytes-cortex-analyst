## Script

### [0:00-0:30] Introduction

**[On Screen: Title card with project name and GitHub link]**

**Presenter:**
"Hi, I'm Aaman Lamba, a strategy consultant and author specializing in AI governance and data economy. Today, I'm excited to show you how to build a natural language interface for data analytics using Snowflake's Cortex Analyst.

This demo uses the publicly available Tasty Bytes dataset - a fictional food truck franchise with customer loyalty data. By the end of this video, you'll see how business users can ask questions in plain English and get instant insights, without writing a single line of SQL."

### [0:30-1:15] Architecture Overview

**[On Screen: Architecture diagram]**

**Presenter:**
"Let me quickly explain the architecture. We have four layers:

**First**, the data layer - this is the Tasty Bytes dataset in Snowflake with customer demographics, sales, and location information.

**Second**, the semantic layer - a Snowflake semantic view that translates technical database columns into business-friendly terms. For example, 'TOTAL_SALES' becomes 'total sales amount generated by each customer.'

**Third**, the AI layer - Cortex Analyst, powered by a large language model that understands natural language, maps questions to business concepts, and generates SQL automatically.

**And finally**, the interface - either Snowflake Intelligence or the Cortex Analyst UI where users interact through a simple chat interface.

The beauty of this approach is that the semantic layer acts as a governed, reusable business logic layer that multiple applications and users can leverage."

### [1:15-3:30] Live Demo

**[On Screen: Snowflake Intelligence or Cortex Analyst interface]**

**Presenter:**
"Now let's see it in action. I'm logged into Snowflake, and I have my Tasty Bytes Customer Analytics agent ready. Watch how it responds to natural language questions.

**[Demo Query 1]**
Let me start with a simple question: 'How many customers are in our loyalty program?'

**[Type and submit query]**

Look at that - Cortex Analyst understood my question, generated the appropriate SQL query using COUNT DISTINCT on customer_id, and returned the result: 11,420 customers. Notice how it shows me the SQL it generated - this transparency is crucial for trust and verification.

**[Demo Query 2]**
Let's try something more complex: 'Which countries have the highest number of customers?'

**[Type and submit query]**

Excellent! It automatically generated a GROUP BY query with proper ordering. I can see the United States leads with over 5,000 customers, followed by India and Egypt. The results are clearly formatted and easy to understand.

**[Demo Query 3]**
Now for a revenue question: 'What's the total sales by country, ranked from lowest to highest?'

**[Type and submit query]**

Perfect! Notice it correctly interpreted 'lowest to highest' as ascending order. The SQL includes SUM aggregation, GROUP BY country, and ORDER BY in ascending order. All numeric values are automatically rounded to 2 decimal places, as we specified in our semantic view's custom instructions.

**[Demo Query 4]**
Let's find specific customers: 'Show me the top 5 customers by total sales'

**[Type and submit query]**

Great! Now I have detailed customer information including names, cities, and sales amounts. This would be perfect for a customer success team wanting to identify high-value customers for personalized outreach.

**[Demo Query 5]**
One more - something more analytical: 'Compare customer counts between United States and India'

**[Type and submit query]**

Excellent side-by-side comparison. The agent understood I wanted a comparison and generated a WHERE clause with an IN condition, then grouped and sorted the results appropriately."

### [3:30-4:15] Setup Overview

**[On Screen: Quick walkthrough of setup steps]**

**Presenter:**
"Now, how do you build this yourself? It's remarkably straightforward.

**Step one**: Load the Tasty Bytes dataset using the provided SQL script. This takes about 5-10 minutes and creates all the necessary tables and views.

**Step two**: Create the semantic view using our YAML specification. This is a one-time setup that defines your business logic, metrics, and dimensions. Takes about 2 minutes.

**Step three**: Create a Cortex Analyst agent in Snowsight. Simply navigate to AI & ML, create a new agent, and add your semantic view as a tool. Takes about 3 minutes.

That's it! The entire setup takes less than 30 minutes, and you have a production-ready natural language interface for your data.

All the code, including the semantic view YAML, setup scripts, and detailed documentation, is available in the GitHub repository linked in the description."

### [4:15-4:45] Benefits & Use Cases

**[On Screen: Key benefits list]**

**Presenter:**
"Why is this powerful?

**One**: It democratizes data access. Business users don't need to learn SQL or wait for analysts.

**Two**: It's governed. The semantic layer ensures consistent metrics and enforces data access controls.

**Three**: It's transparent. You can always see the generated SQL and verify the logic.

**Four**: It's extensible. Add more dimensions, metrics, or even additional data sources as needed.

This pattern works for any industry - retail, financial services, healthcare, SaaS. Anywhere you have structured data and want to make it accessible through natural language."

### [4:45-5:00] Closing & Call to Action

**[On Screen: GitHub and HuggingFace Space links]**

**Presenter:**
"I encourage you to try this yourself. The GitHub repository has everything you need to get started, including:
- Complete setup scripts
- The semantic view YAML definition
- Detailed documentation
- Example queries and troubleshooting tips

There's also a HuggingFace Space where you can explore the demo interactively.

If you build something cool with this, I'd love to hear about it. Star the repo, share your experience, or open an issue if you have questions.

Thanks for watching, and happy querying!"
