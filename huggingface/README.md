# Tasty Bytes Customer Analytics - Cortex Analyst Demo

This interactive demo showcases a natural language interface for customer data analytics built with **Snowflake Cortex Analyst**.

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates

Ask questions in plain English and get instant insights from customer loyalty data:

- "How many customers are in our loyalty program?"
- "Which countries have the most customers?"
- "Show me the top 10 customers by total sales"
- "What's the average sales per customer in each country?"

**No SQL knowledge required!** The AI understands your questions and generates the appropriate queries automatically.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This demo is built on:
- **Data Layer**: Snowflake TASTY_BYTES public dataset
- **Semantic Layer**: Native Snowflake Semantic View (business-friendly data definitions)
- **AI Layer**: Cortex Analyst (LLM-powered query understanding)
- **Interface**: Chat-based natural language interface

## ⚠️ Important Note
